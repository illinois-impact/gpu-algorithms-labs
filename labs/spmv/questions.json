        "Consider an MxN sparse matrix with Z non-zeros and a maximum of k non-zeros per row. How much storage (in number of words) would a CSR representation of the matrix require? How much storage (in number of words) would a JDS representation of the matrix require? ",

        "In the JDS format, what is the advantage of storing the data contiguously along the jagged diagonal instead of along the row?"
